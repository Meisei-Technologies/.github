# Meisei: Innovation in Every Command Line_
Meisei is a company founded in 2021 originally as **Mijikai Sound Department**. 
Although no longer exclusivly focus on audio, Meisei's work on sound formats and sound cards has paved the way for the company's diverse catalogue of both hardware and software.

## What do we do now?
As of 2025, Meisei has expanded its services to not only technology, but to automobiles too, however we're focusing on the tech for now.
